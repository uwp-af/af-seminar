# Server and Postman Workshop

## HTTP request breakdown

### Headers:

- Header fields allow the client to pass additional information about the request, such as info about the client and specific info if needed.
- A common specific field will be `Authorizaion` which would be passed to prove a client is authenticated.

### Body

- This is an optional part of a request, this is all a preference with the API you are using. The body in most cases transfers data around.

### Parameters/Query

- This is also optional, but if a service is running off of parameterized queries it will be needed to use it.
- Websites use query parameters a lot when searching.

## What is Postman

- A tool to communicate with your API without needing to make a client.
    - Testing purposes
    - Mock requests
